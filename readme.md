## Lab 4
Your task in this lab is to continue working on operator overloading in C++. This time, you are going to work on more arithmetic operators, and const operators. Make sure you have C++ installed, and you are familiar with the header files, and coding files. If you need help, ask your
TA to help you with this. Then, you should do the following programming task. Each programming task in the lab is a design based on the subjects you learned during lectures. There is a test code that you can use to test your design. If you have questions, ask your TAs. Most random generators start from a seed or some seeds to generate a sequence of random numbers. Design a class that represents a sequence of a random numbers. The method that we use for generating random numbers use two seeds and it works as follows. The first two numbers in the random numbers sequence are given, which are the two seeds. To generate the next random number, we calculate the multiplication of the two previous numbers and keep the ùë† digits in the middle. If the multiplication does not have 2ùë† digits, you should add leading 0s. Your class has ùë†
as one of the private members.

## How to run the code
